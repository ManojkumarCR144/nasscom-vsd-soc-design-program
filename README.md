# NASSCOM-VSD-SoC-Design-Program  
Exploring the ASIC design flow using OpenLane and the SkyWater 130nm PDK, a collaboration between Google and SkyWater. This program, led by industry expert Kunal Ghosh, provides hands-on experience in standard cell design, physical design, and GDSII generation.

## DAY 5 

###  Final step for RTL2GDS using tritinRoute and openSTA

first step is to build  the power distribution network by follwing command :
```
gen_pdn

```

To check PDN, open Magic tool go to /tmp/floorplan/ indside the run folder in openlane directory by using below commands :

```

magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &
```
