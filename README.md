### PRELAYOUT TIMING ANALYSIS AND CLOCK TREE SYNTHESIS <ul>
The next step is to get the **.lef** file from the inverter design.

Open the tracks.info file 
directory is : 
```
openlane_working_dir/pdk/sky130/libs.tech /openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd/track.info 
```

now the *sky130_inv.lef* file is created in *vsdstdcelldesign* folder in *openlane* directory.

The next step is to copy the newly created *.lef* file to src folder of *picorv32a* directory along with some important libraries.

libraries are present in following directory

## DAY 5 

###  Final step for RTL2GDS using tritinRoute and openSTA

first step is to build  the power distribution network by follwing command :
```
gen_pdn

```

To check PDN, open Magic tool go to /tmp/floorplan/ indside the run folder in openlane directory by using below commands :

```

magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &
```  Commands to load PDN def in magic in another terminal

```bash
  #Change directory to path containing generated PDN def
  cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-02_22-08/tmp/floorplan/

  #Command to load the PDN def in magic tool
  magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &
```

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fd43f7a-7363-4929-bb47-2f5bd4de3534)
  Final step is routing to run routing use below command :

```
run_routing
```

Routing is done.

To view the final design  with routing in Magic tool , go to the results/routing/ in  the runs folder of openlane directory by using below command :

```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.def &

## Acknowledgement


I want to give a big thank you to Mr. Kunal Ghosh, one of the founders of VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp. Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Nickson Jose for their amazing help during the DIGITAL-VLSI-SOC-DESIGN-AND-PLANNING workshop. They really know their stuff when it comes to chip design using OpenLANE software and other cool techniques. Their guidance has been super valuable in teaching me all about it.
