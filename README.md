## DAY 1 : 

### INTRODUCTION

In the DAY 1 lecture series 

   - Learned how VLSI technology packs tons of tiny transistors onto chips, making electronics faster, smaller, and cheaper.

   - Looked at an Arduino board to understand why its main 'chip' is a big deal.
   - Saw how this chip, known as the microcontroller unit (MCU), runs everything on the board, like reading sensors and controlling lights.
   - Noticed how VLSI tech helps make these chips, making gadgets like Arduinos possible.
   - The Arduino Microcontroller Board comprises various elements like the microprocessor, voltage regulator, I/O pins, and communication interfaces. The microprocessor, highlighted , acts as the brain, executing instructions and managing the board's functions. 
 
 <li> Chip Packaging and Components </li>
 <br>
- The places that make chips, called <b>'FOUNDRY'</b>, are really important for how well chips work.
<br>
- <b>'MACROS'</b> are digital parts inside chips that make them work better.

<br>

 There are three main components ,they are:
 
1) <b>Core</b>: Refers to the region where our complete logic will be implemented.

2) <b>Pads</b>:Through pads signals travel from external sources to chip or vice-versa.

3) <b>Die</b>: Refers to the entire area of the chip.

<br>

Above shows simplified RTL to GDSII flow.Steps invloved are explained as follows:

**Step 1 - Synthesis:** -In thi stage RTL is converted to gate level netlist using components from the Standard Cell Library(SCL). These components, known as Standard Cells, have regular layouts with varying widths.

**Step 2 - Floor Planning & Power Planning: :** In floor planning, we decide where to put components on the chip to make it as small as possible. We also plan where to put inputs, outputs, dimensions and power connections.

In power planning, the power supply network (VDD & GND) using special components of chip will be laid out.  

**step 3 - Placement:**

During placement, we put components and standard cells in their designated spots on the chip. We do this in two steps: first Global Placement, then Detailed Placement.

**step 4 - CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis):**

Before connecting signals, we organize the clock signals to avoid timing issues. We use special structures to make sure the clock arrives at different parts of the chip at the same time.

**step 5 - Routing:**

Once the clock is set up, we connect the rest of the signals. We use the remaining metal layers to make these connections. First, we plan out the routes (Global Routing), then we actually make the connections (Detailed Routing).

**step 6 - Sign-off:**

Finally, we check if everything is correct. We make sure the design follows the rules (Design Rule Check - DRC), matches the plan (Layout Vs. Schematic - LVS), and meets timing requirements (Static Timing Analysis - STA).


## OPENLANE AND STRIVE CHIPSETS

OpenLane began as an open-source project aiming to facilitate a genuine open-source tape-out experiment. It originated from e-fabless and serves as a platform that incorporates various tools like **Yosys, OpenRoad, Magic, KLlayout**, and other open-source tools. OpenLane streamlines the different stages of silicon implementation, making them easier to understand and work with. At e-fabless, they have a series of SOC (System on Chip) designs called Strive. Strive SOCs are entirely open, featuring open PDK (Process Design Kit), open RTL (Register Transfer Level), and open EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.

The Main aim of Openlane is to **produce clean GDSII without human intervention.**

### TOOL INVOCATION & OPERATION:

- We're using the Sky130_fd_sc_hd PDK variant.
- "Sky130" refers to the process or node name.
- "fd" indicates the foundry name, which is SkyWater foundry.
- "sc" denotes standard cell library files.
- "hd" represents high density, a specific variant.
- The Sky130_fd_sc_hd variant includes various technology files such as Verilog, Spice, Techlef, Meglef, Mag, GDS, CDL, LIB, LEF, etc.
- The techlef file provides layer information essential for the design process.

  <br>

<ul


    
**<li>Directory order to invoke the tool OPENLANE </li>**
```
Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
```

In order to enter into BASH in terminal ,we must use a command 
```
docker
```

Now enter the follwing commands to invoke the openlane in terminal i.e using bash programming:

```
-bash-4.2$ pwd
/OpenLANE_flow 
-ls -ltr ( it includes several files like flow.tcl,scripts,conf.py files,README files  nearly 136 files etc) as shown in below image

### GETTING STARTED - SYNTHESIZING THE DESIGN :

Next step is we need to perform the Synthesis process on the design. command used is

```
run_synthesis
```
It'll take a while (1-2 min) to perform synthesis but once it's done,we will see a message saying **'Synthesis was successful'**.
![Screenshot from 2025-02-08 12-15-36](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd5d598f-6e4c-420a-9270-6fc1f7dd1bbc)
Total number of counter D flip-flops is **1613** and the total number of cells is **18036**.
The flipflop percentage is obtained by formula i.e **Flop Ratio = ((no of D_flipflops) / (Total no of cells))100**
so we get Flop ratio =(1613/18036)*100 = **8.94 %.**




## DAY 2
Configuration variables and their default values for *floorplanning* , *placement* , *CTS* , *Routing* , *magic* and *LVS*.

### CHIP FLOOR PLANNING CONSIDERATION 

<ul>
    
**<li> UTILIZATION FACTOR AND ASPECT RATIO </li>**

In order to calculate the Utilization Factor and Aspect Ratio, we must know the height and width of core and die areas.
formula is given by:

**Utilization Factor = area occupied by the netlist / Total area occupied by the core**

--> If the utilization factor is 1 then it denotes 100 % utilization.
--> We never go for 100 % utilization, we go for 50 % or 60 % factor.

**Aspect Ratio = height of the core / width of the core**

--> When aspect ratio is 1 , then its a square chip.



### STEPS TO RUN FLOORPLAN & REVIEW FLOORPLAN FILES 

Once synthesis is sucessful,next step is floorplan. we use command 
```
run_floorplan
```
This will create a folder inside **runs** folder of **picorv32a** directory.
it will take a while to execute.once done we will get **PDN GENERATION IS SUCESSFUL** as shown in below image.
![Screenshot from 2025-02-08 12-16-47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4273110-7375-4fd9-b618-68d5fb65a8e5)
![Screenshot from 2025-02-08 12-26-25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd1dd0e-436c-4c3c-931c-58195a28c19b)
Units is measured in microns,
**DIEAREA** is given in the below image:
![Screenshot from 2025-02-08 12-31-52](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d61aa11-5b4e-43ea-af14-a8cdf80a8814)

To see the actual layout after the floorplan ,go the folders as shown below:
```
openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/16-05_16-20/results/floorplan
```

now we need to open the **magic** file by the  following command
<br>

```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &
```

![Screenshot from 2025-02-08 12-58-22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201ae215-b1f2-45a0-b9af-7b64272cad95)
<br>
To zoom in press left button of mouse then right button and press z 
<br>
![Screenshot from 2024-05-16 22-38-02](https://github.com/akshaynayak212/NASSCOM-VSD-SoC-Design-Program/assets/169296665/5e7db0d4-169e-4faf-ba66-ddf3a5f50b6e)
<br>

In order to know the details of any cell in the layout , just move the cursor to that cell and press **S** to select the cell and then in the window of **tkcon** enter the command **"what"**. then it will displey the details of the selected cell.
lets see the detail of horizontal and vertical pins , in tkcon window it shows that the pin is in the metal 3 for horizontal pins ,similarly for the vertical pins, we see that thepin is at metal 2. image is shown below.

<br>
</ul>


### STEPS TO RUN PLACEMENT

Once the Floorplanning is done sucessfully , the next step in the process is Placement. 
To run the placement use the command
```
run_placement
```
![Screenshot from 2025-02-20 22-53-27](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82915ef4-a8a5-4f93-94f6-01e630ed9511)



Once Placement process is done , next step is to check whether the cells are placed correctly or not.by using **magic** tool.

use the below command to view the standerd cells placement. image is shown below
```
magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &

next step is to calculate the rise time , fall time , cell rise delay and cell fall delay:
click on the waveforms to get values i.e 

--> 20 % of VDD (3.3 V) is 0.66V
--> 80 % of VDD (3.3 V) is 2.64V
--> 50 % of VDD (3.3 V) is 1.65V
<br>
1) **Rise time**- Time taken to the output waveform to 20% value to 80% value.

## DAY 5 

###  Final step for RTL2GDS using tritinRoute and openSTA

first step is to build  the power distribution network by follwing command :
```
gen_pdn

```

![Screenshot from 2025-02-16 18-57-08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/319210c7-e6c8-4ab0-8b19-2da4ea31682a)

To check PDN, open Magic tool go to /tmp/floorplan/ indside the run folder in openlane directory by using below commands :

```

magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &
```  Commands to load PDN def in magic in another terminal

```bash
  #Change directory to path containing generated PDN def
  cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/03-02_22-08/tmp/floorplan/

  #Command to load the PDN def in magic tool
  magic -T /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read 14-pdn.def &
```

## Acknowledgement


I want to give a big thank you to Mr. Kunal Ghosh, one of the founders of VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp. Pvt. Ltd., and Mr. Nickson Jose for their amazing help during the DIGITAL-VLSI-SOC-DESIGN-AND-PLANNING workshop. They really know their stuff when it comes to chip design using OpenLANE software and other cool techniques. Their guidance has been super valuable in teaching me all about it.
